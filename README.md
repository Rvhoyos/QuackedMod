## Features
![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Rvhoyos/QuackedMod)
![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Rvhoyos/QuackedMod?style=social)

- **Custom** GeckoLib model/animations.
- **Follow‑the‑leader** behavior: flocks self‑organize into lines.
- **Migration** bursts: the lead duck occasionally chooses a distant spot and the line ambles over.
- **Natural spawns** across temperate, taiga, wetlands, rivers, and shores (rarer away from water).
- **Tempted** with seeds; breeds like chickens.
- **Quack**, hurt, and death sounds.
- Duck **Eggs**, Ducks lay eggs periodically.
- **Taming & Sitting the lead duck**: With food they eat! (Currently only available in a feature/pre-release branch)
- **Customizable** JSON config, allows users / servers to include more biomes from the game or other mods. ( **Currently broken** )
### Drops & Items
- **Duck Meat** and Cooked Duck foods.
- **Duck Feathers** for crafting.
- **Duck‑feather Arrow** variant.
- **Foie Gras** (late‑game food) with short, meaningful buffs.

# Dev
## Building distributable JARs (Gradle)

**Prereqs:** JDK 21+, Git, and the Gradle wrapper included in this repo.

From the repo root, build each loader **module** explicitly:
> Jars can be found under <modloader>/build/libs **not** under common folder.

# Fabric release jar
`./gradlew :fabric:remapJar` or `./gradlew :fabric:build`
### running into issues?
`./gradlew :fabric:clean :fabric:build`
# NeoForge release jar
`./gradlew :neoforge:remapJar` or `./gradlew :neoforge:build`
### running into issues?
`./gradlew :neoforge:clean :neoforge:build`
